# Hi!
My name is **Anton Zejdler**. I am a student and a _programmer_.
# Areas of development
- [Embedded](https://github.com/ezyxip/ezyxip/edit/master/README.md#embedded)
- [Backend](https://github.com/ezyxip/ezyxip/edit/master/README.md#backend)
- [Android](https://github.com/ezyxip/ezyxip/edit/master/README.md#android)
## Embedded
Development of software for hardware complexes in C. I have worked on projects aimed at creating multifunctional radio complexes. I solved the problems of interaction of low-level components with each other in conditions of low resources and high importance of real-time data processing, modification of protocols for interaction of FPGA components and integration of devices among themselves.
I worked with: 
- Hardware platforms
  * FPGA Virtex
  * Milandr
  * GD32
- IDE
  * Keil uVision 5
  * Eclipse

I love the Java language and server-side data processing. You can see my technology stack above. I am trying to develop towards the creation of fault-tolerant, distributed systems that operate with large amounts of data without problems. Data and data manipulation is cool!

## Android
Any Javist sooner or later comes to learn the principles of **android development**. Here I discovered the powerful and concise Kotlin language, which makes many useful additions to the Java environment. I'm learning about the **Jetpack Compose** framework and the **Kotlin** coding language. Now I can develop multi-window android applications using **Compose Navigation**, which work with various _data stores and the network_
